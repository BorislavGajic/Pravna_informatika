Start the app by firstly activating the virtual environemnt with: 
* .\venv\Scripts\activate 
 * if not created then use `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
___
After that use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install needed python modules - _just for first time use_
___
The application is started via `flask run --reload` for hot reload enabled

_python app.py works as well :)_
